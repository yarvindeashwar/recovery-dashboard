# Recovery MIS Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard for recovery operations intelligence using BigQuery data.

## üöÄ Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

Follow these steps to deploy your dashboard to Streamlit Cloud (free hosting):

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `recovery-dashboard`
3. Make it public (required for free Streamlit Cloud hosting)

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recovery-dashboard.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository and branch (main)
5. Set the main file path: `recovery_dashboard.py`
6. Click "Advanced settings"

### Step 4: Add Secrets in Streamlit Cloud

In the Advanced settings, add your secrets:

```toml
[gcp_credentials]
type = "authorized_user"
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
refresh_token = "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
universe_domain = "googleapis.com"
```

**Important**: Copy the exact values from your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file (which is gitignored and won't be uploaded to GitHub).

### Step 5: Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait for your app to build and start. It will be available at:
`https://YOUR_APP_NAME.streamlit.app`
